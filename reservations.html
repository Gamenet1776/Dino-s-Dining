        <p>Due to the popularity of our diner, it is required for every customer to make a reservation. 
            How do you make one? Well, it is simple. First, indoors or outdoors? Ultimately, it is up to you. Both choices provide an excellent experience, so you canâ€™t really go wrong with one or the other. 
            Lastly, you have two options to make a reservation - online or phone.</p>
