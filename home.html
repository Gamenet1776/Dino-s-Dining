        <h2> Location </h2>
        <p>Our restaurant, Dino Dinning, is located near the Safari Lodge on Isla Nublar. 
            It's not particularly hard to find, although if you need a map there is one listed below. 
            The Safari Lodge is located near the top center of Isla Nublar. 
            A general overview of the outside of the restaurant is a flashy, overgrown building with blaring lights. 
            The inside of the restaurant is even more intriguing, we decided that the best course of action to make our restaurant substantial was to make something similar to the Rainforest Cafe. </p>
