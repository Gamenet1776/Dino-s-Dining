        <h2>Usual Experience</h2>
        <p>When you take your first step in our diner, you may be excited or frightened by those huge dinosaurs scattered throughout the place. No need to worry, they aren&rsquo;t animate, and if they happen to be, life finds a way. Typically, there isn&rsquo;t a long line because only reservations are allowed. Except, if you arrive more than 15 minutes late, you have failed your very first task and as a punishment, you&rsquo;ll have to make a new reservation. Once you are introduced to your seat(s), you&rsquo;ll only have to wait a minute until your order arrives fresh and delicious. You may fear showing bad table manners. No need to worry, there&rsquo;s no wrong way to eat! If you want to eat like a real dinosaur, go ahead, we&rsquo;ll happily cheer you on. If you rather not, that&rsquo;s completely fine, we still appreciate you for choosing us as your hosts.</p>
