        <p>Due to the popularity of our diner, it is required for every customer to make a reservation. 
            How do you make one? Well, it is simple. First, indoors or outdoors? Ultimately, it is up to you. Both choices provide an excellent experience, so you can&rsquo;t really go wrong with one or the other. 
            Lastly, you have two options to make a reservation - online or phone.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>IMPORTANT</strong> - It is recommended to come at least 5 minutes prior to your scheduled time. If you come more than 15 minutes after your time, your reservation is canceled and you will have to make a new one. Don&rsquo;t waste our time and we won&rsquo;t waste yours.
